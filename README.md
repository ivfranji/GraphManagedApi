# Graph Managed Api

Microsoft Graph Managed API - Rich library for interacting with Microsoft Graph. In this iteration majority of Exchange related tasks are covered which helps with transition from EWS Managed API (Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices) to Microsoft Graph.

Entire Microsoft.Graph model is generated in rich fashion in order to provide seamless experience while using it.

It supports property change tracking locally, handling throttling etc... Please visit wiki with examples how to set it up and use it in your environment.

Please report any issues or feature request directly on github and I'll try to address it in timely manner.
